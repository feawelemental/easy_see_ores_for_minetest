# easy_see_ores_for_minetest
Makes ores easier to see by adding a box based on the main color theme of the ore around the ore. Compatible with the Epic server.
Diamond, copper, iron, coal, mese, and tin textures came from https://github.com/minetest/minetest.git by SmallJoker.
Rose Thennium, Garnet, Bloodstone, Sulfur, Titanium, and Actinolite textures came from https://notabug.org/NathanS21/Epic.git by Nathan Salapat.
The idea for this texture pack came from the visible ores pack https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/visible-ores by Techy69.
I am not completely sure how to give credits, but I think I gave all credit where due.
